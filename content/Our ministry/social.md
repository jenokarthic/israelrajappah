We regularly visit slums, leper colonies and hospitals and pray with the sick and deprived people there. 
<!--more-->
We toil in the hot sun to take the gospel to the downtrodden as Jesus did. We distribute food, clothing etc., to the lepers, widows and poor and needy village people to show the love of Christ and pray with them for the physical and spiritual needs, to deliver them from the bondages of sin, sickness and satanic fears, by the dynamic power of the holy spirit. We need sponsors who could support these charity and gospel works. Also we need sponsors who could support our full time pastors. It will be highly appreciated if you could support them by giving US dollar 80 or English pounds 50 (or) Euro 60 per month. 

If the needs of their family are met, they will be doing the Lordâ€™s work without worries. James 2:26 states faith without deed is dead. As children of God, bound by His eternal love, the mission renders various social activities.
