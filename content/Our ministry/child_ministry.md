Teach them to walk and practise in the light of the word of God 
<!--more-->
We have always strongly felt that the Gospel must be presented along with social service of some kind and our children’s Nursery school cum crèche stands testimony to our faith. This set up is meant for Children from poor backgrounds and at present we have 60 children in it. We teach them to salvation at a young age. These children need uniform, books, mid-day meals and the like. The School itself needs furniture. We need sponsors who can support one child by giving US Dollar 40 (or) English Pounds 25 (or) Euro 30 or Rs.250/- per month. We also have Sunday Schools, Vacation Bible Schools, Camps and retreats for the children to get them to know and understand the true love of God and to teach them to walk and practise in the light of the word of God.
