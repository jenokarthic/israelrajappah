Since we are located very close to several schools, College and universities,  
<!--more-->
   we make it a point to meet students in their hostels atleast once in a week. We distribute Bibles and Christian Literature and given the opportunity, we share with them the Love of Christ. Our labour often gives much fruit as several young boys and girls give their hearts to the Lord and regularly attend the Sunday worship service. Some of them have even committed themselves to the holy covenant of Baptism. They have all become strong witnesses for the Lord and they would leave their schools and colleges with not just an academic degree but also an eternal degree, the salvation of Jesus Christ. Besides various youth meetings, campus and retreats are conducted for the spiritual enhancement of the younger generation. Various awareness programmes against alcoholism, smoking and environmental and social hazards are also organised for to bring up better change of the younger generation.
